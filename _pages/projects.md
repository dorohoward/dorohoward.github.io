<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Molecular Simulation for COâ‚‚ Capture</b> <br>
    Frontiers in Chemistry, 2021 - Bahamon, Wei, et al. <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Developed a molecular simulation framework to evaluate amine-functionalized MOFs for post-combustion COâ‚‚ capture. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, quantified adsorption isotherms, selectivity, and regenerability across several amine configurations. Established structureâ€“property relationships and laid the groundwork for future ML-assisted design of porous adsorbents.

    <b>Mechanistic and Microkinetic Modeling of COâ‚‚ Hydrogenation on Niâ€“Mo Catalysts</b> <br>
    J. COâ‚‚ Utilization, 2021; J. Phys. Chem. C, 2022 - Wei, et al. <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A two-part project combining DFT, charge-density analysis, and Python-based microkinetic modeling to explore COâ‚‚ hydrogenation on MoOâ‚“-modified Ni surfaces. Identified how MoOâ‚“ species modify adsorption energies, reaction barriers, and selectivity between methanation and RWGS reactions. Linked surface electronic structure and catalytic activity through quantitative descriptors.

  <li>
    <b>First-Principles Study of Helium Migration in Zirconolite</b> <br>
    J. Nuclear Materials, 2025 - Wei, Kaltsoyannis <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">First-principles investigation of helium migration in zirconolite, a complex oxide with high chemical durability. Employed DFT, AIRSS, and CI-NEB methods to map anisotropic diffusion pathways and vacancy-mediated trapping/detrapping mechanisms. Quantified pressure-dependent diffusion coefficients and provided a transferable computational framework for defect and diffusion modeling in functional ceramics.

  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Adsorption and Reaction Energetics of Biomass-Derived Molecules</b> <br>
    (Ongoing project, University of Manchester) <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Studying fructose adsorption and dehydration on sulfonated silica catalysts using DFT-based surface modeling. Constructed conformer and slab libraries to analyze binding geometries and active-site effects. Combined ab initio thermodynamics and ML-driven data curation to accelerate catalyst optimization for selective dehydration of biomass-derived molecules.
