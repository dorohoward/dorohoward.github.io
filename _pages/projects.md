ðŸš€ Projects
------
1.  **Data-Driven Molecular Simulation for COâ‚‚ Capture** <br>
   Frontiers in Chemistry, 2021 - Bahamon, Wei, et al. <br>
   Developed a molecular simulation framework to evaluate amine-functionalized MOFs for post-combustion COâ‚‚ capture. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, quantified adsorption isotherms, selectivity, and regenerability across several amine configurations. Established structureâ€“property relationships and laid the groundwork for future ML-assisted design of porous adsorbents.

2.  **Mechanistic and Microkinetic Modeling of COâ‚‚ Hydrogenation on Niâ€“Mo Catalysts** <br>
   J. COâ‚‚ Utilization, 2021; J. Phys. Chem. C, 2022 - Wei, et al. <br>
   A two-part project combining DFT, charge-density analysis, and Python-based microkinetic modeling to explore COâ‚‚ hydrogenation on MoOâ‚“-modified Ni surfaces. Identified how MoOâ‚“ species modify adsorption energies, reaction barriers, and selectivity between methanation and RWGS reactions. Linked surface electronic structure and catalytic activity through quantitative descriptors.

3.  **First-Principles Study of Helium Migration in Zirconolite** <br>
   J. Nuclear Materials, 2025 - Wei, Kaltsoyannis <br>
   First-principles investigation of helium migration in zirconolite, a complex oxide with high chemical durability. Employed DFT, AIRSS, and CI-NEB methods to map anisotropic diffusion pathways and vacancy-mediated trapping/detrapping mechanisms. Quantified pressure-dependent diffusion coefficients and provided a transferable computational framework for defect and diffusion modeling in functional ceramics. 

4.  **Adsorption and Reaction Energetics of Biomass-Derived Molecules** <br>
   (Ongoing project, University of Manchester) <br>
   Studying fructose adsorption and dehydration on sulfonated silica catalysts using DFT-based surface modeling. Constructed conformer and slab libraries to analyze binding geometries and active-site effects. Combined ab initio thermodynamics and ML-driven data curation to accelerate catalyst optimization for selective dehydration of biomass-derived molecules.
