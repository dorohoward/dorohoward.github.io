<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <b>Computational Chemistry</b> at the <b>University of Manchester</b>, advised by Prof. Nikolas Kaltsoyannis. Before joining Manchester, I earned my M.S. degree in Chemical Technology from <b>Tianjin University</b> (Prof. Qingfeng Ge) in 2022 and a B.E. in Chemical Engineering and Technology from the <b>China University of Petroleum</b> in 2019. I also completed exchange programs at Khalifa University (Prof. Lourdes F. Vega) and Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (Malaysia).  
  <br><br>
  My background lies in theoretical and computational chemistry, with expertise in <b>density functional theory (DFT)</b>, <b>molecular simulations (VASP, LAMMPS)</b>, and <b>quantum chemistry calculations (Gaussian)</b>. I am also proficient in <b>Python</b> for data analysis and workflow automation.  
  <br><br>
  Recent projects include <b>CO₂ hydrogenation on Ni–Mo catalysts, helium diffusion in zirconolite</b>, and <b>fructose dehydration on silica</b>. By integrating physics-based simulations with data-driven modeling, I aim to accelerate the <b>computational discovery of materials for sustainable energy, electronic, and biomedical applications</b>, with particular interests in semiconductors, batteries, and drug design.
