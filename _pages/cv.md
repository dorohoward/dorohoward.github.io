**Projects**
1.  **Data-Driven Molecular Simulation for COâ‚‚ Capture** <br>
   Frontiers in Chemistry, 2021 - Bahamon, **Wei**, et al. <br><br>
   I developed a molecular simulation framework to evaluate amine-functionalized metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) for post-combustion COâ‚‚ capture. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, we quantified adsorption isotherms, selectivity, and regenerability across several amine configurations. Through systematic data analysis, this work established quantitative structureâ€“property relationships and laid the foundation for future machine-learning-assisted design of porous adsorbents for gas separation and carbon capture.

2.  **Mechanistic and Microkinetic Modeling of COâ‚‚ Hydrogenation on Niâ€“Mo Catalysts** <br>
   J. COâ‚‚ Utilization, 2021; J. Phys. Chem. C, 2022 - **Wei**, et al. <br><br>
   This two-part study combined density functional theory (DFT), charge-density analysis, and Python-based microkinetic modeling to explore COâ‚‚ hydrogenation on MoOâ‚“-modified Ni catalysts. 
   In the first paper (J. COâ‚‚ Util., 2021), I investigated how MoOâ‚“ surface species alter COâ‚‚ adsorption, activation, and electron redistribution at Ni interfaces. 
   In the follow-up work (J. Phys. Chem. C, 2022), I constructed microkinetic models using Python to identify rate-determining steps and selectivity-controlling factors between CHâ‚„ and CO. 
Together, these studies linked surface electronic structure to catalytic performance and demonstrated how DFT data workflows and kinetic modeling can guide rational catalyst design.

3.  **Adsorption and Reaction Energetics of Biomass-Derived Molecules** <br>
   (Ongoing project, University of Manchester) <br><br>
   I am currently studying fructose adsorption and dehydration mechanisms on sulfonated silica catalysts using DFT-based surface modeling. By building a library of conformers and slab configurations, this work provides insight into binding geometries, reaction energetics, and active-site effects relevant to sustainable biomass conversion and green chemical production. The project combines ab initio thermodynamics and ML-driven data curation to accelerate catalyst optimization for selective dehydration pathways.

4.  **Defect Chemistry and Diffusion in Functional Ceramics** <br>
   J. Nuclear Materials, 2025 - **Wei**, Kaltsoyannis <br><br>
   This project investigates helium diffusion and defect-assisted transport in zirconolite, a complex oxide with outstanding chemical durability. Using DFT, ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), and climbing-image nudged elastic-band (CI-NEB) methods, I identified anisotropic migration pathways, vacancy-mediated trapping/detrapping mechanisms, and pressure-dependent diffusion coefficients. These results reveal how local defect structures control long-range transport and stability in functional ceramics, providing computational strategies applicable to energy storage and advanced waste-resistant materials.
